# CNN-Architecture-Implementation
# CNN Architecture Implementation from Scratch (NumPy)

A from-scratch implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers and architectures designed for the **CIFAR-10** dataset. 

## 🧠 Key Features
* **Vectorized Layers:** High-performance implementations of `Conv2D` (using im2col logic), `MaxPool2D`, `BatchNorm2D`, and `Dropout2D`.
* **Classic Architectures:** Full implementations of **LeNet-5** and a modular **Mini-VGG** network.
* **Advanced Optimization:** Includes both **SGD with Momentum** and the **Adam** optimizer.
* **Data Pipeline:** Custom CIFAR-10 loader with real-time **Data Augmentation** (horizontal flips).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Core Library:** NumPy
